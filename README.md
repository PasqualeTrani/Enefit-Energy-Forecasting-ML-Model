# Enefit-Energy-Forecasting-ML-Model
The repository contains the code for building a Machine Learning Model for the Kaggle Competition "Enefit - Predict Energy Behavior of Prosumers", where the challenge is to predict the amount of electricity produced and consumed by Estonian energy customers who have installed solar panels. The data mainly consist of weather data, the relevant energy prices, and records of the installed photovoltaic capacity.
